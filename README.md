# Algorithm Visualizer Graph

The **Algorithm Visualizer Graph** is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize various graph algorithms. Whether you're a student studying algorithms or a developer curious about graph traversal techniques, this tool provides an intuitive way to explore and understand these concepts.


## Usage

- Select a graph algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Customize the graph by adding nodes and edges.
- Click the **Visualize** button to see the algorithm in action.

## Features

- **Graph Visualization**: The application renders graphs and displays them visually.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of graph algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path, breadth-first search, depth-first search, and more.
- **Custom Graph Creation**: Users can create custom graphs by adding nodes and edges.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: The tool guides users through the algorithm step by step, highlighting the relevant nodes and edges.



## Tools Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The core technologies for building the web application.
- **D3.js**: A powerful library for creating interactive visualizations.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
